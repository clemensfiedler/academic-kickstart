abstract = "The interconnected nature of modern markets and the steep costs of research and development force direct competitors to cooperate in their R&D efforts. Cooperation can take many forms ranging from collaborative standard-setting to research joint ventures and open-knowledge initiatives. Firms face a trade-off between their objectives. Collaboration between firms benefits them collectively as it allows firms to share the results of their R&D investments. However, it also harms them as their investments also benefit their competitors.

In this paper, we study how the market characteristics can encourage or discourage firms to invest in a shared standard. We show that the quality of the products sold in the market exhibits a hump-shaped reaction with respect to the number of firms in the standard and the degree of competition firms face from outside the standard. We find that market-based entry in the standard is too high in case of a low competition from outside the standard as entry undermines the incentives of firms to cooperate. Thus, higher entry barriers can increase investment in the standard."
