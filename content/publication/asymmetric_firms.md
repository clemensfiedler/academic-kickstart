abstract = "In this paper, we study how three characteristics typical to modern software markets impact the strategic decisions of firms. First, instead of charging prices to end-users firms generate revenue indirectly via advertisement or secondary products and compete on quality. Second, the costs of providing a high-quality product increase in the number of customers but at a quickly decreasing rate. Third, firms are asymmetric in size, with large and small firms coexisting in the same market. We show that firms' quality choices can be strategic complements or substitutes. A large firm reacts to an increase in the quality of a small firm by lowering its quality, while a small firm reacts to an increase in the quality of the large firm by raising its efforts. Thus, large firms act as quality leaders. We use these results to study an intervention aimed at moving market shares from a large to a small firm. Such an intervention was tried by the European Commission in the web browser market. We show that in a software market, moving market shares from a large to a small firm can lower the incentives to provide a high-quality product for both firms, thus harming all customers."
