# About Me
I'm an ever-curious, driven & hard-working person and enjoy seeking and overcoming the puzzles that everyday life presents me with.

Professionally, I'm a Ph.D. Student in Economics at Tilburg University specializing in the competition and innovation in software and other high-tech markets. The goal of my research is to understand what drives firms to innovate. How can we increase firms' incentives to do so? How is this different in modern software markets with interconnectet products and asymmetric firms?

My supervisors are [Jan Boone](http://janboone.github.io/homepage/) & [Florian Sch√ºtt](https://sites.google.com/site/schuettflorian/).
