# About Me
I'm an ever-curious, driven & hard-working person and enjoy seeking and overcoming the puzzles in my professional, academic and personal life.

Professionally, I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Tilburg University specializing in competition and innovation in software and other high-tech markets. The goal of my research is to understand what drives firms to innovate and how their behavior is impacted by the unique characteristics of these modern markets. Doing so will give us a new perspective on how to increase firms' incentives to invest in R\&D and provide high-quality products. Within my research I make heavy use of analytical and numerical procedures as well as webscraping.

My supervisors are [Jan Boone](http://janboone.github.io/homepage/) & [Florian Sch√ºtt](https://sites.google.com/site/schuettflorian/).
