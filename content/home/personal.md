I am a curious person and try not to limit myself to one field of study. I am especially interested in Physics and the natural sciences in general. Besides that, I enjoy reading and watching Science Fiction and Futurology and playing Strategy Games.

In my free time I enjoy climbing, running, swimming and cycling.
